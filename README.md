# Code-Quiz

I created a coding quiz that was a t first highly complicated. By breaking it down I was able to get it to a timer and scoring to work. I was able to comment out most of the complicted code.

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score
